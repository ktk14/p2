## Description
This is a xkcd style password generator in PHP. Form inputs how many words to use, whether to have a number and/or special symbol and includes basic server-side validation.

## Details for teaching team
I am rusty and sadly loops and I have always had issues. I hope it turned out ok.
I had a difficult time trying to get a default value of 4 words to show even when the user had an error so I left the password field blank when there was an error.

## Outside code
*Examples from class (error reporting commented out for production, but used locally)
